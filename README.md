# Marx Zuckerburg

## Preamble

A spectre is haunting the internet: the spectre of communism.

All the powers of the corporate internet have entered into a holy alliance to exorcise this spectre: Zuckerburg and Bezos, Google and Apple, neoconservatives and neoliberals.

It is high time that Communists should openly, in the face of the whole world, publish their aims to overthrow this digital capitalism with its own digital tools.

It is high time that Communists embrace and even accelerate technological change.

Has the internet deterritorialized our social and material life? So be it.

Near-instantaneous communication across vast distances and the infinite reproduction of intangible data will be made our tools: not of capitalist 'disruption' but of communist revolution.

It is high time we seize the means of digital production.

I am building a ['socialist network' called Komrade](http://komrade.app) as an experiment in designing new socialist technologies.

The following are my thoughts and reflections on that process, as well as on technology, labor, and society.
